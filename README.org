* Usage


Customize the =yahoo-weather-location= which supports chinese characters and then:

~M-x yahoo-weather-mode~

You  can set =yahoo-weather-guess-location-function= to a function that sets =yahoo-weather-location= string. For now there's only  =yahoo-weather-ipinfo=, which gets location from https://ipinfo.io/ server.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq yahoo-weather-guess-location-function #'yahoo-weather-ipinfo)
#+END_SRC

By default it will only display the weather and temperature.

You can specify =yahoo-weather-format= to display more information and access other settings by =M-x customize-group yahoo-weather=.
